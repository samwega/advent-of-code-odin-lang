Learning Odin as my first programming language (that explains some of the comments). Starting with Advent of Code 2015.

## How to run
**Command example:**
`odin run advent_of_code\2015_05.odin -show-timings -file -vet -o:speed`

For fun and playing with ideas of optimization, some of the challenges are timed. The times listed in comments are with the `-o:speed` flag on. Timings without the compiler optimization flag are as much as 10 times slower.
